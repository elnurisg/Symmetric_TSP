This folder contains a Python script that reads cost values from text files, plots the data, and saves the plots as PNG files. Each text file corresponds to a plot of cost values and is generated using the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm with a time limit of 5 seconds and with different types of kicks, which correspond to the names of the files. VNS is based on a Greedy Heuristic with the starting mode set to 2 (trying all initial nodes and choosing the best one) and without GRASP. Instance used: a280.tsp
